Prototype 4 Final Project

My goal for this environment was to make the player feel like they were a tiny action figure in a normal(human) sized kitchen. I have fond memories of playing some shooter game as a kid where you played as the green plastic army guys, and one of the levels was in a kitchen where everything was massive compared to you. I wanted capture this sort of feeling by making a large kitchen environment where the player is very small and is able to run and jump on the counters, fridge, etc. The goal is for the player to collect all five golden pepper mills. While some of them are tricky to get to, they are all possible to collect. I do not know why, but the footstep audio is very weird, and to audio for picking up the collectables only plays sometimes. After you spend some time looking around, there is also a stopwatch to see how fast you can collect all five pepper mills. Esc back to the main menu to restart the timer and see how fast you can collect all 5. My best time is 29.50. Good luck!
